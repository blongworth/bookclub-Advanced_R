# Function factories and manufactured functions

- Functions are objects
- Functions return whatever objects they produce, even if it's a function!

```{r factory-basics}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}
```


```{r}
# Manufactured functions
square1 <- power1(2)
cube1 <- power1(3)
square1(8)
```

---

# Manufactured function environments

Let's see what our functions are doing...

.pull-left[
```{r}
square1
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
cube1
```
]

Well, that's not useful. Let's look at the functions' environments using `rlang::fn_env()`

```{r}
c(fn_env(square1)$exp, fn_env(cube1)$exp)
```

---

# Where does exp come from?

Exp comes from the enclosing environment, not the function body.

# Promise dangers

Lazy evaluation + factories = **danger**

```{r bad-factory}
x <- 2
square <- power1(x)
x <- 3
```

What does `square(2)` return?

--

```{r}
square(2)
```

Uh oh.
---

# Lazy Factories

#### The value of `exp` isn't evaluated until it's needed - creating `square` doesn't need to know `exp`, so R waits until we need a value for `exp`.

#### Our factory builds functions that aren't complete until the user runs them!

---

# Forcing evaluation

`force(x)` forces evaluation by evaluating `x`<sup>*</sup>

```{r repaired-factory}
power2 <- function(exp) {
  force(exp)
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}
```

.footnote[*Technically just `exp` instead of `force(exp)` does the same thing, but `force()` makes our intentions clear.]

---

# {factory}

Jon Harmon (@jonthegeek) created a [package](https://github.com/jonthegeek/factory) to handle some of the fancy stuff. Uses `{rlang}` and quasinotation ([Chapter 19](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html)) to work its magic<sup>*</sup>.

.pull-left[

Use `factory::build_factory()` to produce our power function.

```{r factory}
power3 <- factory::build_factory(
  function(x) {
    x ^ exponent
  },
  exponent
)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

Same shenanigans for `my_exponent` as before.

```{r}
my_exponent <- 2
square3 <- power3(my_exponent)
my_exponent <- 3
square3(2)
square3
```
]

# Stateful functions

.pull-left[
```{r}
new_counter <- function() {
  i <- 0
  
  function() {
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}

counter_one <- new_counter()
counter_two <- new_counter()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
counter_one()
counter_one()
counter_two()
```
]

.footnote[Since we're in the section on functional programming, are these counters pure functions and/or good functional style?]

---

# {ggplot2}

*Lots* of ggplot2 functions accept functions as arguments

```{r geom-help}
?ggplot2::geom_histogram
```

> `binwidth` The width of the bins. Can be specified as a numeric value **or as a function that calculates width from unscaled x.** Here, "unscaled x" refers to the original x values in the data, before application of any scale transformation. When specifying a function along with a grouping structure, the function will be called once per group...

---

# Histogram binwidths

.pull-left[
```{r hist-badbin, eval=FALSE}
# construct some sample data with very 
# different numbers in each cell

sd <- c(1, 5, 15)
n <- 100

df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(3 * n, sd = sd), sd = rep(sd, n))

ggplot(df, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) + 
  facet_wrap(~ sd, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(x = NULL)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="hist-badbin", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Define binwidths with function-fu

.pull-left[
```{r hist-goodbin, eval=FALSE}
binwidth_bins <- function(n) {
  force(n)
  
  function(x) {
    (max(x) - min(x)) / n
  }
}

ggplot(df, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = binwidth_bins(20)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ sd, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(x = NULL)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="hist-goodbin", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# {scales}

The {scales} package is full of function factories.

```{r scales}
scales::number_format
```

---

# Functional function factories with functionals

.pull-left[
```{r}
names <- list(
  square = 2, 
  cube = 3, 
  root = 1/2, 
  cuberoot = 1/3, 
  reciprocal = -1
)
```


```{r}
funs <- purrr::map(names, power1)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
funs$root(64)
funs$root
```
]

---

# Avoiding $itis...

#### Using `with()`
```{r}
with(funs, root(100))
```

#### Using `attach()`
```{r, message = FALSE}
attach(funs)
root(100)
detach(funs)
```
